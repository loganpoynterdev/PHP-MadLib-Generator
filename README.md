# PHP MadLib Generator
This is a PHP Madlib generator created as part of my college coursework. It's quite simple and makes use of POST for collection of variables and then uses them in the results. Unfortunately cannot link directly to the project as its hosted internally behind the schools firewall and have not setup hosting on my own for it.
